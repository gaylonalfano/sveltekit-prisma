			We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Talk to trees,
			look at the birds. Whatever it takes. It's beautiful - and we haven't even
			done anything to it yet. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay
			around in the sky all day long. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make
			friends with it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Exercising the
			imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to
			me, are truly the windows to your soul. Everyone is going to see things
			differently - and that's the way it should be.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You
			can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Just
			use the old one inch brush.
